# Scala Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Scala Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/scala-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787280595), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Scala is a functional programming language that supports OOP principles and it’s quite challenging to develop scalable and reactive applications without any framework/library support. This video course is designed to help Scala programmers who have very basic knowledge of the Scala language build real-world applications from scratch using the Play and Akka frameworks with the underlined concurrency resolution mechanism.

In this course you will learn various features of the Play and Akka frameworks by building 5 real-world applications with increasing complexity. Beginning with a simple project, a product catalog-listing application, the course will take you through building a customer data entry application, a string processing application to get a word count, a message passing app like Ping pong actors example and Dining-philosophers problem-in humus.

Each project will help you master the programming and data capabilities of Scala. By the end of the course, you will not only be empowered by knowing the ins and outs of Scala, but you will also be able to apply them to solve a variety of problems.
